##Â Configure local Docker Environment

The configuration of a local Docker environment is rather simple. Depending on your OS you just have to install the Docker Community Edition for MacOS, Windows or Linux according the official Docker documentation. As soon as you have Docker install you have to prepare the software.

- clone git repositories

```bash
cd /u00/app/oracle/local
git clone https://github.com/oehrlis/docker.git docker
git clone https://github.com/oehrlis/o-db-docker.git o-db-docker
git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git docker-images
```

- create folder for you software

```bash
mkdir /u00/app/oracle/software
```

- download the different oracle binaries as required
